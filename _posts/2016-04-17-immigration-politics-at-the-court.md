description: "On Monday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in United States v. Texas, one of the most flagrant examples in recent memory of a naked political dispute masquerading as a legal one. In this case, 26 Republican-led states brought suit against President Obama's November 2014 executive actions to protect millions of immigrants from deportation."
